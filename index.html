            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <article>
                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
                    language.
                    Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects
                    of its
                    environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
                <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
                    language
                    elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for
                    a variety
                    of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>

            <article>
                <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open VS Code, name a file that end with .js, and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript
                  code:</p>
                <pre>
                <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
                  greetMe("World");</code>

            <h2>Variables</h2>
            <article>
                <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called
                  identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
                <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters
                  can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z"
                  (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
                <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape
                  sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>
              </article>

        <section id="declaration">
            <h2>Declaration</h2>
            <article>
                <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
                <p>With the keyword var. For example,</p>
                <code>var x = 42.</code>
                <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.</p>
                <p>By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
                <code>x = 42.</code>
                <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this
                  variant.</p>
                <p>With the keyword let. For example,</p>
                <code>let y = 13.</code>
                <p>This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.</p>
              </article>
        </section>

        <section id="variable-scope">
            <h2>Variable Scope</h2>
            <article>
                <article class="main-article">
                    <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available
                      to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local
                      variable, because it is available only within that function.</p>
                    <p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a
                      block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code
                      will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the
                      block, which in this case is an if statement.</p>
                    <pre>
                    <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
                    </pre>
                    <p>This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015</p>
                    <pre>
                    <code>if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not
                      defined</code>
                    </pre>

        <section id="global-variables">
            <h2>Global Variables</h2>
            <article>
              <p>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window, so
                you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.</p>
              <p>Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or frame by
                specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document,
                you can refer to this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.</p>

          <section id="data-types">
            <h2>Data Types</h2>
            <article>
              <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Six data types that are primitives:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                    <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the
                      same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
                    <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
                    <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                    <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                    <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
                  </ul>
                <li>and Object</li>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </article>
          </section>

          <section id="constants">
            <h2>Constants</h2>
            <article>
              <p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the
                same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain
                alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.</p>
             <pre>
              <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
             </pre>
              <p>A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It has to be
                initialized to a value.</p>
              <p>The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const keyword is
                omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.</p>
              <p>You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For example:
              </p>
              <pre>
              <code>// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS WILL
                CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g; //statements
                }</code>
              </pre>
              <p>However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement is executed without problems.</p>
              <pre>
              <code>const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";</code>
            </pre>
